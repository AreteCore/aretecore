# I'm Rich, and I **still* like to solve problems.

## What's been going on?
I don't want to say I gave up coding, but the reality is that when I finished General Assembly's bootcamp in August of 2022, almost immediately some of the top FAANG companies started wave after wave of layoffs. **Around 70,000**, to be more specific, according to [this article](https://fi.money/blog/posts/faang-company-layoffs-what-caused-it-how-did-it-affect-their-stocks). 
As much as I wanted to get into tech, I had to be realistic. I had been a research coordinator at a top California University and the grant was coming to an end; I was grinding applications and getting nowhere. Fortunately, my boss referred me to another position at the University and I was hired there. I have also been working actively on my side projects, teaching Digital Literacy and Financial Literacy to formerly incarcerated populations in Los Angeles for various non-profit re-entry services organizations such as the [Anti-Recidivism Coalition](www.antirecidivism.org).

# My Curated Resources List
*This is a list of curated learning resources that I personally like.*   

[Code Analogies](https://www.codeanalogies.com/) - An excellent place to look up all the esoteric coding things that you may not quite understand as a beginner.  
[Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) -  A really nifty way to learn a lot of coding stuff. I would love to learn their language *Imba* at some point.  
[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) - JavaScript30 is a really nice way to learn JS, with bite-sized guides.  
[Miro](https://www.miro.com) - A visual collaboration board that has literally everything. Amazing.  
[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - A cool game for learning CSS Flexbox.  
[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com)  - A cool game for learning CSS grid.  
[Edabit](https://edabit.com) - I like their coding challenges, they start off very easy and get significantly harder.

Try [Sindre Sorhus' Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) if you want a *massive* resource that has a bit of everything. Caution: It is overwhelming.  I've still not seen it all.  
*More to come*
