## Curated Resources List
*This is a list of curated learning resources that I personally like.*
### 

[Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) -  A really nifty way to learn a lot of coding stuff. I would love to learn their language *Imba* at some point.  
[Miro](https://www.miro.com) - A visual collaboration board that has literally everything. Amazing.  
[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) - JavaScript30 is a really nice way to learn JS, with bite-sized guides. Fun.

*More to come*
