# I'm Rich, and I like to solve problems.

## My advice to brand-new developers:
Learn *commitment* and learn *patience* above all. And beware of *paralysis*.

### **Commitment**
It's going to take a lot of time to learn what you need to learn. Just get to it. Don't get bored or procrastinate.

### **Patience**
It's going to be frustrating. Just take a deep breath and try to pivot to something else, or even better, ask for help.

### **Avoid Paralysis**
There are a million guides on the internet that will teach you to do everything you want to learn. It's overwhelming at times; I know it was for me at first. A lot of the learning process is learning to separate what works from what doesn't. Below I have a list of resources that I highly recommend for newbies. They helped me a lot, and they will help you too. But things are always changing and you can always find more. 

Try [Sindre Sorhus' Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) if you want a *massive* resource that has a bit of everything. Caution: It is overwhelming.  I've still not seen it all.  

# My Curated Resources List
*This is a list of curated learning resources that I personally like.*   

[Code Analogies](https://www.codeanalogies.com/) - An excellent place to look up all the esoteric coding things that you may not quite understand as a beginner.  
[Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) -  A really nifty way to learn a lot of coding stuff. I would love to learn their language *Imba* at some point.  
[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) - JavaScript30 is a really nice way to learn JS, with bite-sized guides.  
[Miro](https://www.miro.com) - A visual collaboration board that has literally everything. Amazing.  
[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - A cool game for learning CSS Flexbox.  
[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com)  - A cool game for learning CSS grid.
[Edabit](https://edabit.com) - I like their coding challenges, they start off very easy and get significantly harder.
